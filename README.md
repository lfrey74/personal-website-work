#PERSONAL WEBSITE WORK

#### Primary Purpose

This repository will include personal projects in addition to projects
assigned in The Odin Project online course. The purpose of these will
be to practice and further develop skills learned in the course.

#### Secondary Purpose

The secondary purpose of this repository will be to share my creations
with others to get feedback on my projects to help me get outside views
and opinions with the goal of removing my personal preferences for
design and learning to design towards other's desires or needs.

#### Sources

The projects will have sources from The Odin Project assignments and
from personal designs I wish to build upon.
