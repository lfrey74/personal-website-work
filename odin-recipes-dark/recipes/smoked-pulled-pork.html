            <li>Place pork shoulder in a large pot and add enough
                apple cider to cover. Combine white sugar, brown
                sugar, salt, paprika, onion powder, black pepper,
                and garlic powder in a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Mix 1/4 of sugar rub into cider; reserve remaining rub.
                Cover the pot and refrigerate for 12 hours. Preheat the
                smoker to 210 degrees F (99 degrees C). Add enough wood
                chips to the smoker.
            </li>
            <li>Pour cider brine into the water pan of the smoker; add

            </li>
            <li>Spread remaining sugar rub over pork shoulder. Transfer
                pork to the center of the smoker.
            </li>
            <li>Smoke pork until very tender or until it reaches an
                internal temperature of 200 degrees F (95 degrees C),
                about 8 hours. Monitor hickory chips and liquid, adding
                more as needed.

            <li>Transfer pork to a large platter and cool for 30 minutes
                before shredding with forks.
