# PROJECT: ODIN RECIPES

#### Description:

This project originated in The Odin Project online course. This
repository is a personal branch of the project for development
and practice of skills learned in the course.

#### First Upload

The first upload included all files, with the main style.css updated
in the Block and Inline section of the course. A new style.css file
was created in the recipes subfolder to modify the style of the
recipe pages, but was not part of the instructions. Rather, it was my
first personal modifications to the website.


#### Future Iterations

This project will be modified both through instructions in the
course and with my own designs to further enhance my learning
experience through continued practice.
